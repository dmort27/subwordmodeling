<p>After the annotation phase, you should have a good sense of the main themes of
the overall text as well as a hint of how biased the author is. The next phase
is designed to help you concretize this intuition by answering a set of
structured, objective questions about the overall text related to bias and
equity. The current questions, in order are as follows, with example responses
from the text examined in the <a href="annotate.html">annotation phase</a>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Example Answer For Davenport Passage</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the overall claim or idea made in this text?</td>
      <td>The mixing of races will lead to decreased “peace and unity of ideals” on Earth</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Who is making this claim?</td>
      <td>Charles Davenport</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>To whom is this claim applied? Is the target of the claim specified explicitly, or implied?</td>
      <td>Davenport explicitly mentions white people, Chinese, Negroes, and “other groups”</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>To whom is this claim being made? Is the intended audience clear?</td>
      <td>By singling out a “homogenous group of white people”, we might infer that this is his intended audience</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Does the claim implicitly or explicitly include or exclude certain groups? If so, who? If not, what information do we have about the included/excluded groups?</td>
      <td>The text explicitly mentions whites, Chinese, Negroes, native American Indians, and mixed races including Mulattos.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that <strong>explicit quotations from the text are included</strong> in some of the
answers. These quotations should be the direct evidence in the text that led you
to your answer of the question. Note that the “Who is making this claim?”
question may not have associated quotations, but quotations from other sources
that describe the author may be used with appropriate citations. These questions
should help you form a high level conceptual view of the perspective of the
author, and how the text is biased or exclusionary.</p>
