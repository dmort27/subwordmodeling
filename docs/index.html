<p>The goal of this course is to <strong>lead students to engage broadly with the existing NLP and computational linguistics research on subword modeling</strong> and <strong>develop new computational approaches to problems in morphology, orthography, and phonology</strong>. In addition to three other miniprojects, students will be expected to produce one piece of research that can be developed into a conference or workshop paper (though submission is not a course requirement). The paper should be suitable for the “Phonology, Morphology, and Word Segmentation” tracks of the *ACL conferences, the SIGMORPHON workshop, Coling, or LREC.</p>

<h2 id="course-objectives-top">Course Objectives <a class="tiny-link" href="#">Top</a></h2>

<p>At the end of this course, students will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Express a sophisticated understanding of the fundamentals of morphology, phonetics, writing systems, and phonology</li>
  <li>Understand current papers in computational phonology, morphology, and orthography</li>
  <li>Implement current subword models of language and carry out publication-quality experiments in this area</li>
  <li>Write publication-quality papers reporting computational research in phonology, morphology, and orthography</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="course-principles-and-classroom-guidelines">Course Principles and Classroom guidelines</h3>

<p>This course will be based around discussion of readings, guided by handouts. There will be no slides and no recordings of lectures. There are three groundrules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All class members are expected to have read the readings prior to the beginning of the lecture.</li>
  <li>All class members have a way of taking notes on handouts (e.g., a tablet + stylus or a printed copy and a pencil/pen). Handouts will be provided at least 24 hours in advance of class. If there is enough demand, the instructor can print copies of the handout for student use.</li>
  <li>All class members will treat other members of the class with dignity and respect.</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="prerequisites"></a></p>
<h2 id="prerequisites-top">Prerequisites <a class="tiny-link" href="#">Top</a></h2>

<p>The course is open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates who have completed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One prior course in NLP</li>
  <li>One prior course in ML (preferred, but not required)</li>
</ul>

<p>This course is a judgement free and
anti-racist learning environment. Our cohort consists of students from a wide
variety of social identities and life circumstances. Everyone will treat one
another with respect and consideration at all times or be asked to leave the
classroom (physical or virtual).</p>

<p>The instructors of this course pledge to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Learn and correctly pronounce everyone’s preferred name/nickname</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use preferred pronouns for those who wish to indicate this to me/the class</p>

on Religious Observance
(http://www.bu.edu/ctl/university-policies/policy-on-religious-observance/).
Please make sure to communicate about religious observances as far in advance
as possible (and no later than one week before the observance, per university
policy) so that accommodations can be made.</p>

<h3 id="assignment-completion--late-work">Assignment Completion &amp; Late Work</h3>

<p>Assignment can be submitted on their
scheduled due dates by 11.59.59 EST via Perusall/dropboxes or alternately they
may be emailed to melosbor@bu.edu. Assessment and feedback will be provided
via Perusall grading function. A late penalty of -10% per day will be
assessed, though deadline extensions are available on a case by case basis (the
earlier the instructor is informed of conflicts/extension needs, the better).</p>

<h3 id="illness-and-assignment-deadlines">Illness and Assignment Deadlines</h3>

<p>We hope that all of you will remain
healthy throughout the semester and are able to fully engage and participate in
the course. If you do unfortunately become ill, we require that you follow the
protocols mandated by the University under those circumstances. The course
attendance and engagement policies already reflect substantial flexibility to
allow for absences of short to moderate length due to illness. Please make
sure to contact your instructor about any absences that will last beyond a
couple of days. In the case of a prolonged illness that is not already covered
by the course absence policies, we will work with the CAS Dean’s office to
determine the best course of action for any given student.</p>

<h3 id="academic-conduct">Academic Conduct</h3>

<p>The community at Boston University has adopted the
following Academic Conduct Code: “All students entering Boston University are
expected to maintain high standards of academic honesty and integrity.”
Obviously, the full text is more detailed. The expectation is that you will
adhere to this code, as your instructor pledges to do as well. For more
information, please visit this website:
http://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/. In keeping with
this code, cheating, plagiarism, or any other form of academic dishonesty will
not be tolerated (ACC III) and will be referred to the Dean’s Office.</p>
