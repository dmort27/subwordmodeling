Short description of course objectives

### Course Principles and Classroom guidelines

In this class:
* Feeling discomfort is normal - it is a sign of challenge and growth
* It’s ok to make mistakes, so long as we are dedicated to becoming better
* This room is a space for respectful dissent
* The goal is not to agree - it is to gain a deeper understanding.

Classroom ground rules:
* Listen actively - respect others when they are talking.
* Speak from your own experience instead of generalizing ("I" instead of "they," "we,"
and "you")
* Participate to the fullest of your ability - community growth depends on the inclusion
of every individual voice.
* Although no one experience or example will prove accurate 100% of the time, we will
try to hear the truth in what is said instead of looking for exceptions to the case.
* Assume everyone’s good intentions but also acknowledge the impact of saying
something that hurts someone else, even if it is unintended.

### Office Hours

Scheduled for 2 hours weekly, based on best cohort
availability. In person meetings with the instructor are always available upon
request.

### Office of Disability and Access Services

The Office of Disability and
Access Services (25 Buick Street, Suite 300) is responsible for assisting
students with disabilities. If you have a disability, you are strongly
encouraged to register with this office. Lecture hall and discussion rooms are
accessible and ADA compliant.

### Learning and Testing Accommodation
Boston University complies with the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. If
you are a student who needs academic accommodations because of a documented
disability, you must present your letter of accommodation from the Office of
Disability and Access Services directly to the instructor as soon as possible.
If you have questions about documenting a disability or requesting academic
accommodations, contact the Office of Disability and Access Services. Letters
of accommodations should be presented as soon as possible to ensure that
student needs are addressed from the start of the course. Instructors are not
able to provide accommodations without documentation from Boston University's
Office of Disability and Access Services.

### Support from the Instructor

Finally, if you tell me that you are having
trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. You do not owe me an
explanation of your health (physical or mental) or the health of your loved
ones; but you are welcome to tell me and I will listen. Even if I can’t help
you directly, it is likely that I know someone who can. If you need help or
more information, please ask, and I will work with you.

## Class and University Policies <a class="tiny-link" href="#">Top</a>

### Diversity, Inclusion, Anti-racism

This course is a judgement free and
anti-racist learning environment. Our cohort consists of students from a wide
variety of social identities and life circumstances. Everyone will treat one
another with respect and consideration at all times or be asked to leave the
classroom (physical or virtual).

The instructors of this course pledge to:

1. Learn and correctly pronounce everyone’s preferred name/nickname

2. Use preferred pronouns for those who wish to indicate this to me/the class

3. Work to accommodate/prevent language related challenges (for instance I will avoid the use of idioms and slang)

### Attendance

Attendance is not used as a criterion for assessment in this course. This a primarily in-person course and lectures and discussion are held at BRB115.  
Zoom links and recordings will be made available during/after each session to accomodate the ongoing COVID situation until Feb 18, 2022 and as directed by BU policy.

### Policy on Religious Observances

Due dates can be revised for documented
religious observances according to the specifications of the University Policy
on Religious Observance
(http://www.bu.edu/ctl/university-policies/policy-on-religious-observance/).
Please make sure to communicate about religious observances as far in advance
as possible (and no later than one week before the observance, per university
policy) so that accommodations can be made.

### Assignment Completion & Late Work

Assignment can be submitted on their
scheduled due dates by 11.59.59 EST via Perusall/dropboxes or alternately they
may be emailed to melosbor@bu.edu. Assessment and feedback will be provided
via Perusall grading function. A late penalty of -10% per day will be
assessed, though deadline extensions are available on a case by case basis (the
earlier the instructor is informed of conflicts/extension needs, the better).

### Illness and Assignment Deadlines

We hope that all of you will remain
healthy throughout the semester and are able to fully engage and participate in
the course. If you do unfortunately become ill, we require that you follow the
protocols mandated by the University under those circumstances. The course
attendance and engagement policies already reflect substantial flexibility to
allow for absences of short to moderate length due to illness. Please make
sure to contact your instructor about any absences that will last beyond a
couple of days. In the case of a prolonged illness that is not already covered
by the course absence policies, we will work with the CAS Dean's office to
determine the best course of action for any given student.

### Academic Conduct

The community at Boston University has adopted the
following Academic Conduct Code: “All students entering Boston University are
expected to maintain high standards of academic honesty and integrity.”
Obviously, the full text is more detailed. The expectation is that you will
adhere to this code, as your instructor pledges to do as well. For more
information, please visit this website:
http://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/. In keeping with
this code, cheating, plagiarism, or any other form of academic dishonesty will
not be tolerated (ACC III) and will be referred to the Dean’s Office.

### Proper use of Online Resources

Students at Boston University are required to abide by all regulations
regarding academic integrity and conduct, including the proper use of
technology and digital resources. Course materials are provided by faculty for
your personal use in the course only. Any other use of these materials
including, but not limited to, posting of materials online in forums or
websites, is a copyright violation and a violation of the academic
conduct code. Additionally, materials submitted for course credit (papers,
exams, etc.) are similarly not permitted to be used or posted.

### COVID-19 Responsibilities and Regulations

We are all in this together, and we are committed to offering the best learning
experience possible given the need for safety. To do this, we need your help.
We must all be responsible and respectful. Faculty, staff, and teaching fellows
will wear masks during class and other meetings to protect you; and we expect
you to do the same. If you show up without a mask, you will be asked to leave.
If you refuse, the class or meeting will be dismissed in order to protect
everyone. We also require that you follow the safety practices recommended by
the CDC outside the classroom, including all state and university guidelines
regarding sheltering in place while feeling ill, testing, quarantining, social
contacts, and gatherings. If you cannot follow these guidelines, be responsible
and respectful: do not show up for in-person learning. Do not put your
classmates, staff and instructors in danger. Do your learning remotely to make
it possible for us to safely offer in-person learning to others.

### Copyright Laws and Protection

The syllabus, course descriptions, lab manual, and all handouts created for
this course, and all class lectures, are copyrighted by the course instructors.
The materials and lectures may not be reproduced in any form or otherwise
copied, displayed or distributed, nor should works derived from them be
reproduced, copied, displayed or distributed without the written permission of
the instructors. Infringement of the copyright in these materials, including
any sale or commercial use of notes, summaries, outlines or other reproductions
of lectures, constitutes a violation of the copyright laws and is prohibited.
Please note in particular that distributing, receiving, selling, or buying
class notes, lecture notes or summaries, lab reports or related materials, or
similar materials both violates copyright and interferes with the academic
mission of the College, and is therefore prohibited in this class and will be
considered a violation of the student code of responsibility that is subject to
academic sanctions.
